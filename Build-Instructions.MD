# Build instructions

## **Parts Required**

- **1x** Box – *Dimensions: 350 x 300 x 370 mm*  
- **Insulation material** – *Preferably fireproof*
- x2 M4x50mm screws, washers and nuts (Stepper quick release pins)
- **Components from an Anet A8 3D printer**, including screws:  
  - Heated bed  
  - Hotend thermistor  
  - Mainboard  
  - Power supply unit (PSU)  
  - Layer cooling fan  
  - 1 stepper motor  
  - Endstop switches  

- **3D printed models** – *Linked separately*  
- **2x** External MOSFETs – *Compatible with 12V 3D printer systems*  
- **4x** Silicone bed springs – *For 3D printer heated bed*  
- **1x** TXS0108E TTL level converter  
- **1x** 120mm 12V fan – *For PSU cooling*  
- **1x** 80mm 12V fan – *For internal airflow*

Cut the insulator to size and attach it to all faces of the box. 
If the insulator already has adhesive backing, additional glue isn’t necessary. 
Otherwise, use a heat-resistant adhesive (silicone adhesive is a good option) to ensure it stays securely in place.

Replace the metal springs on the bed by the silicone bed springs, as the metal ones easily scratch the pcb traces on the bed causing a potential short circuit.

Remove the linear bearings on the bed sling base. The base will be used to keep the distance between the bed and the insulator.

Center the bed on the bottom of the box and use the bed as template to make the holes for the screws. Mark the hole placement using a sharpie, then drill through the box and insulator

Make a hole to pass the bed wires to the outside of the box. That hole will be used for the fan wire as well.

Make the holes for the rotating shaft. Center the hole on the shortest vertical walls of the box. 

Mark the holes for the motor/shaft quick release mount and the shaft bearing mount.
